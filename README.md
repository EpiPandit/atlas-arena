AtlasArena is a web platform created by UC Davis to showcase arenavirus modeling. Arenaviruses are responsible for various human diseases of public ehalth interest in Latin America and are spread primarily by rodent vectors. AtlasArena uses data on the rodents presence, human density, and environmental factors to predict where rodents are most likely to come into contact with humans and how these points, or hotspots, will shift as climate change affects the rodents' environments. These hostspots can then be used to predict where arenavirus disease cases in humans are most likely to occur.
