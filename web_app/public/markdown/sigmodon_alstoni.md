# Sigmodon alstoni

Implicated as the rodent reservoir of Venezuelan Hemorrhagic fever causing Guanarito virus, Alstonâ€™s cotton rat (as it is commonly called) is found naturally in the North-eastern part of the continent of South America (countries of Venezuela, Columbia, Suriname, Guyana, Brazil and French Guiana). Its natural habitat is similar to other Sigmodontid rodents that includes flatlands with shrubs, grass and open crop fields on low elevation lands. Most activity of the rats can be observed during daytime (diurnal). Unconfirmed reports of litter size include 3-7 pups.
