# Calomys musculinus

Calomys musculinus, or the Drylands Vesper Mouse, is a nocturnal rodent that inhabits regions of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. It is a reservoir for Junin virus. Its ecological niche is the edges of agricultural fields, where humans can come into contact with the rodentsâ€™ feces and thus become infected.
