# Calomys musculinus

_Calomys musculinus_, or the Drylands Vesper Mouse, is a nocturnal rodent that inhabits regions of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. It is a reservoir for the Junin virus. These rodents are polygamous and produce litters of 5.4 to 7.6 offspring. Its ecological niche includes agricultural fields. These sites are where the Junin virus can be spread to humans, primarily farmers, through aerosolized fecal particles. Infections peak every 3 to 5 years as the rodent density peaks and with the March to June corn harvests.
