# _Oligoryzomys flavescens_

## Common Name
Yellow Pygmy Rice Rat

## Host for Diseases:
Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (Junin Virus), [Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (Andes Virus)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32034891/)

## Family Structure
Very little is known about their reproductive behavior and unconfirmed reports include a litter size of 3-7 pups and seasonality in reproductive behavior. Adults can weigh around 40 grams.

## Habitat
Most commonly found in Southern Brazil, Uruguay, Northern Argentina. These rats can inhabit arboreal, terrestrial, or semi-aquatic areas, and are typically spotted in pasture or croplands. These rats are nocturnal in nature and do not move outside of natural home range. 

## Epidemiology
This rodent spreads the Junin virus primarily to [agricultural workers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780702051012000170), who are exposed to aerosols by the rodents living within their fields. Cases peak from March to June and [every 3-5 years](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751560000308?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=929db02cadd83403), with increased argicultural activity during harvests and peaks in the rodent population.
