Also known as Large Vesper Mouse, _C.callosus_ is the implicated rodent reservoir of Machupo Virus that causes Bolivian Hemorrhagic Fever. It is a nocturnal mice species that is generalist in its habitat and has a wide distribution. Found primarily in Bolivia, it has also been reported in Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. Due to their generalist habitation patterns, they can inhabit a variety of ecological niches. Litter sizes range between 3-5 pups and the adults who weigh between 30-50 grams, do not show sexual dimorphism.
