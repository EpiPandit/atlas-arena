# Guanarito virus

Guanarito virus is the causal agent of Venezuelan Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF), a zoonotic viral disease, in humans. Found first in rural Venezuela, Guanarito virus was named after the city of Guanarito where it was found in Portuguese province of Venezuela in 1988-1990. Being a zoonotic arenavirus, it is primarily rodent-borne and has confirmed reservoir of Short-tailed cane mouse (_Zygodontomys brevicauda_). Another potential reservoir Cotton rat (_Sigmodon alstoni_) has been implicated in spreading Guanarito virus and its close-relative, Pirital virus. VHF is can be severe in some cases with an estimate of 25% mortality just like Argentine Hemorrhagic fever (AHF) and Lassa Fever (LF) which are also caused by arenaviruses. The most risk-prone groups include migrant agricultural workers (mostly male) and their families. The last reported outbreak was seen in early 1990s.
