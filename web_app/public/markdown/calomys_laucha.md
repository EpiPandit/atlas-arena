# _Calomys laucha_

## Common Name
Small Vesper mouse

## Host for Diseases:
Argentine Hemorrhagic fever (Junin Virus), [Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (Laguna Negra Virus)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11791973/)

## Family Structure
Adults weigh approximately 13 grams. Litter size can range from 5 to 10 pups per litter and they follow a monogamous mating and nesting system.

## Habitat
Primarily found in the Chaco plains of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, south eastern Brazil, small parts of Uruguay and Chile. The mice prefer dryer, flat plains with crops or grass covered areas and where soil is sandy that helps them create burrows. Key ecological characteristics include seasonal changes to habitat selection where high vegetation areas are preferred in summer and winters are marked by more peri-domestic and open habitats.

## Epidemiology
This rodent spreads the Junin virus primarily to agricultural workers, who are exposed to aerosols by the rodents living within their fields. Cases peak from March to June and [every 3-5 years](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751560000308?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=929db02cadd83403), with increased argicultural activity during harvests and peaks in the rodent population.
