# Calomys laucha

_Calomys laucha_ or Small Vesper mouse as it is commonly know is one of the three implicated rodent reservoirs of Junin virus that causes Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF) in humans. Primarily found in the Chaco plains of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, south eastern Brazil, small parts of Uruguay and Chile. Adults weigh approximately 13 grams. The mice prefer dryer, flat plains with crops or grass covered areas and where soil is sandy that helps them create burrows. Litter size can range from 5 to 10 pups per litter and they follow a monogamous mating and nesting system. Key ecological characteristics include seasonal changes to habitat selection where high vegetation areas are preferred in summer and winters are marked by more peri-domestic and open habitats.
