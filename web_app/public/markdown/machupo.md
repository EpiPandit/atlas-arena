# Machupo virus

Endemic to Bolivia, Machupo virus is a zoonotic mammarenavirus that causes Bolivian Hemorrhagic fever in humans. Machupo virus, like its close relatives Junin virus, Guanarito virus and Chapare virus, is one of the main New World Arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever. The disease is severe and can lead to a case-mortality rate of 25-35% with acute symptoms but may also lead to debilitating chronic viraemia. The first reported outbreak was in early 1960s and the latest was reported in early 1990s. Recently, sporadic and isolated cases have been reported across Bolivia due to changes in human-rodent interactions. The main rodent reservoir implicated in spreading Machupo virus is _Calomys callosus_ (large vesper mouse).
