text_patient: About 70 percent of human lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections are asymptomatic or so mild that they cannot be distinguished from common respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses.

AtlasArena is a Wellcome Trust-funded research project that aims to create and deploy climate-driven spatio-temporal disease ecology models that predict the risk of infections to humans from old and new world Arenaviruses.
