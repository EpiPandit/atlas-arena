AtlasArena is a **Wellcome Trust**-funded research project that aims to create and deploy climate-driven spatio-temporal disease ecology models predicting the risk of humans infection by New World Arenaviruses. [Developed by researchers at University of California at Davis,] the platform uses Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to simulate the geographical distribution of rodent reservoirs for zoonotic New World Arenaviruses, leveraging occurrence data, bioclimatic, vegetation, and land use datasets. Ultimately these models can be used to improve public health surveillance and monitoring systems as climate change alters the ecological dynamics and spread of these diseases.

**Why Arenaviruses?**

Arenaviruses are the cause of various diseases in Latin America,  such as hemorrhagic fevers. The high mortality rate of such diseases and the possibility of large region-wide outbreaks makes predicting their distribution and thus likelihood of human infection of critical importance.

**Role of Climate Change**

The pathogenic New World Arenaviruses are spread via rodent vectors. Climate change poises to alter factors of these rodents’ habitat such as temperature and vegetation, leading to changes in their distribution and thus the distribution of arenaviruses.

**Uses for the Model**

Ultimately, the new geographic distributions for Arenaviruses provided by Species Distribution Models will supplement and improve public health surveillance as climate change alters the dynamics and spread of these diseases. These models suggest where monitoring for Arenaviruses is most needed as new hotspots and points of transmission between humans and Arenaviruses are created.

**Models to Policy/Other Diseases**

The models depict the regions which will become potential hotspots for arenaviruses. Governments and public health organizations can use this information to focus efforts such as vaccination, surveillance, and testing for viruses on these specific regions.

The modeling done on Arenaviruses could also be applied to other diseases whose distribution will be affected by changes in the climate, such as rodent-borne hantaviruses and those spread by arboviruses.
