AtlasArena is a **Wellcome Trust**-funded research project that aims to create and deploy climate-driven spatio-temporal disease ecology models that predict the risk of infections to humans from new world Arenaviruses. The platform uses Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict the geographical distribution of rodent reservoirs for zoonotic New World Arenaviruses, leveraging occurrence data, bioclimatic, vegetation, and land use datasets.
