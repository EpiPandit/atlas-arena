# methodology

1) The geographic range of the rodent hosts was determined from presence data, gathered from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.
   
2) Changes in land-use, human density, vegetation, and other environmental factors over time was determined.
   - Data on these factors was gathered from LCLUC, World Clim, NDVI, MODIS
   - Data on these factors gathered for three scenarios: the current day and two climate-change futures.
   - Changes in the environment would affect the geographic range of the rodents and where humans came into contact with them.
     
3) The environmental, land-use, human density, and rodent-presence data was compared to form a Species Distribution Model.
   
4) Areas where humans were likely to come into contact with rodents were marked as hotspots. Changes in where hotspots occurred could be seen by comparing the present-day to the future climate-change scenarios.
