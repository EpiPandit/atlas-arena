#  Climate Change Impact on Human-Rodent Interfaces: Modeling Junin Virus Reservoir Shifts

## Summary
Drylands vesper mouse (Calomys musculinus), the main reservoir of Junin mammarenavirus (JUNV)—the cause of Argentine hemorrhagic fever—was modeled to predict its current and future distribution under climate change scenarios. Using tree-based machine learning with bioclimatic and landscape data, the study identified environmental factors shaping its range and projected shifts in disease risk hotspots. Results suggest that under severe warming (RCP 8.5), suitable habitats and transmission zones contract, while moderate scenarios (RCP 4.5) may promote range and hotspot expansion.
